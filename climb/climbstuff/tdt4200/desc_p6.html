<h2>Image processing.</h2>

<p>&rdquo;We have just made an amazing new image processing algorithm. This will change<br />
everything! Now we need you to optimize the code massively. The algorithm developers<br />
need a fast version on their workstations. In addition, the product department believes it will be too slow for our mainstream ARM based devices. I have already told them it you can solve it. You know the presentation to the investors is on next Monday, so get to it.&rdquo;<br />
&ndash; Your boss</p>

<p>This task is real. It is not a toy, example or training task. Solving this in a very good way may have real commercial value. For this task use the files Makefile, ppm.c and newImageIdea.c from the PROBLEMNAME.zip archive. You must also download the flower.ppm file and include it in the same directory as the code.</p>

<p>The Makefile handed out with this Problem set creates an executable named <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">newImageIdea</span>. The program reads the <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">flower.ppm</span> image and creates 3 new images: flower <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">tiny.ppm</span>, flower small.ppm and flower <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">medium.ppm</span>. Use a image program to look at the images.</p>

<p><span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">newImageIdea</span> implements a naive approach to solving the problem. The code is <em>bad</em>. Assume that someone that hardly knows programing wrote the code. You may modify the given Makefile if you think it helps your performance. Make sure that the existing <span style="font-family:courier new,courier,monospace;">make newImageIdea</span> rule still works if you do.</p>
